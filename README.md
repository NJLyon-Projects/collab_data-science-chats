# Introducing Data Science Chats!

## Definition
Data Science Chats is born from a desire to learn and teach peer-to-peer on all things data science and early career. Topics can be best practices or hack-y work arounds -- the only guiding light is that you describe some data management/analysis task that you've found helpful (or request a talk on something you *would* find useful!). For now, we are comprised only of National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) employees but we may organically grow beyond that scope given time.

## Interested in joining?
If you're on the NCEAS Slack, join the `data-science-chats` channel for our living agenda document and Zoom link for hybrid/remote attendees. Not an NCEAS employee but still want to join? Comment on [issue #1](https://github.com/NJLyon-Projects/collab_data-science-chats/issues/1) and we can start the conversation

## Purpose
This repository houses most of the scripts that people share for our weekly meetings. "Most" because using GitHub is not a requirement of presenting to DSC and it could prove to be a very real obstacle for some people to contribute their skills and perspective.
